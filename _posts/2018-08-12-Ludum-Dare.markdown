# Ludum Dare

 Ludum Dare is an event where you create a game from scratch in a weekend based on a theme selected by the community.


## Ice Sheet Meltdown

  This is my first time participating in ludum dare and Ice-sheet Meltdown is my entry. It is a simple 2d game in a tiled-environment where the player collects bottles to increase their score and must prevent the ice they walk upon from melting.

  What I learned from making this game is knowing what you can and cannot do within 48 hours. I planned my scope accordingly and finished the game early. If I were to participate in the competition again, my project would be a bit more ambitious.
