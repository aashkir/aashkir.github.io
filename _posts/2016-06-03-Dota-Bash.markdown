# Some Context about Custom Games

Dota 2 is a MOBA video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. Dota 2 supports the Arcade that houses Custom Games, many of which are developed by the community.

## Dota Bash

Dota Bash is my first custom game, and is inspired by the Crash Bash mini-game "Space Bash". It is developed in Lua which is the scripting language for accessing the API. The UI was developed in JavaScript, CSS and XML. 

It has gained over 10,000 subscribers since lauch.

I've also designed the logo using Adobe illustrator.
