In this project I compared the relative performances of various data structures that implement a Sorted Set Interface. The goal of this project was to compare the mathimatical runtimes to physical runtimes. The data was put together into line graphs.

#### The Data Structures

*   Skip List 
*   ScapegoatTree
*   Treap
*	RedBlackTree
*   2-4 tree

## Comparisons

* find(x)
* add(x)
* remove(x)
