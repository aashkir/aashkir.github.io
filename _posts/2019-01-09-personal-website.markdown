Hello,

this is my new personal website where I'll be hosting all my future projects and blogposts. Head over to the projects page to view some side projects I've done so far, these side projects do not include university projects. The website is WIP.

This site is powered by Jekyll, which generates a static website through template rendering. This theme is by [Mathias Schaeffner](https://github.com/mschaeffner).
