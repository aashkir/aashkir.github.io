# Some Context about Custom Games

Dota 2 is a MOBA video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. Dota 2 supports the Arcade that houses Custom Games, many of which are developed by the community.

## Pango Race

Pango Race is my second custom game, and is a racing game primarily inspired by Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing. It is developed in Lua which is the scripting language for accessing the API. The UI was developed in JavaScript, CSS and XML. 

It has gained over 7,700 subscribers since lauch.
